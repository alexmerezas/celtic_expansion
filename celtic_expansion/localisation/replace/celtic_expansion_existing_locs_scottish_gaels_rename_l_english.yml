 flavor_nor.46.d:0 "Historically, the provinces of Scotland were once viking colonies in the past, and as such they used to be part of the [Root.GetAdjective] land. But this is several centuries in the past by now and the claim from our ancestors on Scotland is minimal at best. However, the Earl of Orkney of the Sinclair clan does have a certain degree of legitimacy to rule over Scotland in our name. We could install the duchy of Alba - the realm of the Scottish Gaels living in the North of Scotland - as a loyal subject of [Root.GetName], and place the Sinclair clan as the ruling duke of it."

 hsc_episcopalianism_desc:0 "There are many competing ideas about how the Church in Alba should be structured and what doctrines should be adopted following the advent of the Reformation. We have opted to retain the hierarchical Bishopric model, which allows for both a clear structure for Church proceedings and a degree of doctrinal independence for clergymen."
 hsc_highland_charge_desc:0 "Gunpowder weapons have revolutionized the battlefield, and the warriors of Alba must adapt. An aggressive new shock tactic has been developed by our generals. Our soldiers will run, preferably downhill, straight into the first enemy volley, firing as they go. After shooting, they will draw more traditional weapons and enter the melee. The speed required for this tactic necessitates that our warriors wear very little in the way of clothing however."
 hsc_highland_clans_desc:0 "The Alban clans are a contentious people. As much as they resent one another, they resent even more the prospect of foreign invaders ruling their ancestral lands. Of course, when the threat of foreign invasion is over, the clans will resume their infighting. There can only be one."
