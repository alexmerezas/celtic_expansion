 ire_strengthen_our_army_desc:0 "While the earls and petty kings of Ireland quarrel among themselves, a far greater danger still lingers to the east. For centuries, the Germanic-speaking realms of Scotland and England have cast their gaze across the sea, seeking to subjugate Ireland. Though their power has waned, it has not vanished. Occupied Meath remains in English hands, a scar of the old Lordship and a certain promise of renewed expansion. If the hard-won Irish independence is to endure, we must begin the unification of the clans at once. Only through strength, preparation, and unity can we hope to withstand what is yet to come."

Forging a powerful fleet of our own will allow us to cut any potential future English and Scottish ambitions short at their source and to carry Irish banners beyond our shores."
